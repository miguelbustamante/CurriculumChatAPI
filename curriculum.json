      "description": "In Panama, where I relocated and lived, I led the implementation of Evolution software for multiple clients, coordinating all project phases from requirements gathering to go-live. I managed full project control, applying best practices in risk management, stakeholder communication, and maintaining the project triangle (scope, time, cost). I closed system functionality gaps by developing custom SQL objects, including stored procedures, views, and T-SQL functions, ensuring compatibility with system logic. I ensured technical solutions met security, performance, and optimization standards, minimizing core system impacts. I conducted impact analyses and integrity validations pre-deployment to ensure production stability. I collaborated with clientsâ€™ functional and technical teams to validate deliverables and tailor payroll, HR, and accounting configurations to local regulations. I documented processes, scripts, and customizations for knowledge transfer and post-implementation support. Acting as a bridge between technical teams and clients, I translated requirements into sustainable solutions. Additionally, I leveraged C# and .NET skills to address country-specific payment nuances in Evolution, enhancing software flexibility and functionality for local needs."
